# Interactive-Resume-Builder
An interactive resume builder website is a dynamic platform that allows users to create professional and personalized resumes quickly and easily. Through an intuitive, user-friendly interface, users can input their personal details, work experience, education, skills, and other relevant information. 
The site guides them step-by-step with customizable templates, interactive prompts, and suggestions tailored to their industry and career goals.

Key features might include drag-and-drop sections, real-time previews, a variety of professional templates, and export options (such as PDF, Word, or online profiles). Users can also receive instant feedback on resume quality, keyword optimization for Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS), and tips for improvement. This ensures users not only build resumes efficiently but also create documents that stand out to potential employers.
